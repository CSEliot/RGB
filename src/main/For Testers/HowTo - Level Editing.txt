Ifr you want to make the game play to your own music, you can type out a simple
string of commands to a .txt file and the game will play along to it.

The beta comes with 1 song and 1 file already made for it. The file.txt must
match the name of the song being played. You'll save both the song and the 
songname.txt into the data folder. Then when the game starts, it'll prompt you
asking if you want to import a new song. you give the songname and it will do 
the rest. This won't be the only way to create levels for the music in the final
version. 

Here are the commands:
(each command must be seperated with a space.)

Beg:      	-The song will begin playing.
W#			-Wait for # seconds before doing the next action.
WSP#		-Automatically set a standard wait time for each command.
Cx#			-Spawn a circle, where x is R,G,B or a combination of the 3.
			*note: a number MAY be placed after each circle spawn command,
			 	telling it to grow at a certain # speed.
CSPy		- this will change the standard	speed y at which ALL colors grow. 
			*note: all speed variables work where a speed of 2 means it takes
				2 seconds to reach the ring's edge. So a speed of 1 means 1 
				second to reach the edge. Decimal values are allowed.
Fx			- Spawn a shooting star at angle x.
Fx,y			- Spawn a shooting star at angle x and speed y. 
FSPy		- change the standard speed at which all stars move. 
:End		- Stop the song.
