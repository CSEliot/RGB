Only use method 2 if the game is crashing.

Setting debug:
	Method 1:
		Launching RGB.py, changing in options, restarting RGB.
		Normal logs made here.
	Method 2:
		Launching main.py (necessary if game crashes immediately.)
		After crashing, a "crash-log" will be made.
		
		
the log file will always be saved to the data/log folder.


Running RGB.py, debug will be on or off depending on what you set it to in
the default settings. It starts off. If the game is crashing BEFORE you can make
it to the options screen, then launch main.py in the src/main folder.
