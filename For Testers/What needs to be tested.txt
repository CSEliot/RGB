Version 1.3:
	Star collision testing.
	Star feel and feedback, gameplay concept.
	Framerate, in campaign mode.
	Menu feedback.
	Sound mixer in loader.py. several different settings for mixer.pre_init()
		should be tried, if default fails. (lines 13-18)
	Also, in loader.py, i set default videodriver to directx this time around,
		it might break, so, if you're getting an error about that, just 
		delete or comment that part out.(lines 21&22)
	Please keep in mind that making things look pretty is meant for the end of 
	development.
