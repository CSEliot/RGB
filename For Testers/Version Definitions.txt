Hey everyone, i'd like to go over how i'm doing the version numbers, and what 
that means for testing deadlines.

So, here are 3 examples: 1.3, 1.24, and 1.24a.


The difference between 1.3 and 1.24 means that there is either a lot of content,
or really important content, in 1.3

The difference between 1.23 and 1.24 means that there is new content, not as 
important.

1.24a/b/c/whatever just means that it's either a quickfix, or 
something i didn't get around to yet.

Anything like 1.3/1.4 DEFINITELY needs to be tested, and decent feedback would
be appreciated.
Anything like 1.31, 1.32, it'd be good just to hear that it works. One night, 
Thomas and I spent 2.5 hours trying to fix 2 things, which we did fix.
Quickfixes should only be tested if you were the one who found the error, or i 
ask you personally.


//Also, pre-X means i'm not asking for any major critiquing, it's probably just
//for online backup, or a small change that i'd like input on.
