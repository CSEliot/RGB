--DEPRECATED-- Needs to be updated.

HOW TO:
	circleCommands takes the following: W, WC, C, CSP, :Stop
	starCommands takes the following: W, WF, F, FSP, :Stop
	genCommands takes the following: JumpTo, BPM, WG, WC, WF
		note: genCommands only sets parameters for BEFORE the song starts.



Here are the commands:
(each command must be separated with a space.)

Play:      	-The song will begin playing. Note: Give BPM and other parameters
					before beginning the song, but there is no wait time before 
					the first song. see example. 
JumpTo,#    -The number you choose is how many seconds in you want the song
					to start, mostly for testing purposes. 
BPM#		-Will set circle and star speed to match beats per minutes of song.
					use http://songbpm.com/ to find a song's bpm.
					BPM will automatically arrange the WSP#, CSP# and FSP#.
					If called DURING the song, it takes affect after next cmd.
					Getting a song's bpm: http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm	
W#			-Wait for # seconds before doing the next circle/star action.
WG#			-Automatically set a global wait time for each circle/star action.
WC#			-Set the wait time before each circle.
WF#			-Set the wait time before each star
Cx,#		-Spawn a circle, where x is R,G,B or a combination of the 3.
			*note: a number MAY be placed after each circle spawn command,
			 	telling it to grow at a certain # speed.
CSP#		- this will change the standard	speed # at which ALL colors grow. 
			*note: all speed variables work where a speed of 2 means it takes
				2 seconds to reach the ring's edge. So a speed of 1 means 1 
				second to reach the edge. Decimal values are allowed.
Fx			- Spawn a shooting star at angle x.
Fx,#		- Spawn a shooting star at angle x and speed #. 
FSP#		- change the standard speed at which all stars move. 
:Stop		- Stop the song. If either star/circle commands runs out of commands
				the level will end.

Required Commands: BPM, Play: :Stop

//Understanding BPM: BPM30 means 1/2 beat per second, or 1 circle per 2 seconds.
//                   BPM60 means 1 beat per second, or 1 circle/star per second.
//					 BPM120 means 2 beats per second, or 2 circles/stars per s.
//     So, a BPM120, in 1 second, 2 circles will reach the ring, with equal 
// 	   distance between each other. So at 00 seconds, circle 1 is made to reach  
//     the ring at 0.5 seconds, and the second ring created at 0.5 seconds, to 
//     reach the ring by 1 second. BPM120 is the same as CSP.5, FSP.5 and WSP.5


Example:

BPM30 Beg: CR CRG CRB1 BPM60 F45 F46 F47 CRG,.5 F90,2 CSP1 CB :End

So what happened above was that we set BPM to 30, began the song and the 
first circle played, a red one. 
- 2 seconds later, a Yellow Circle is made, reaching the ring in 2 seconds.
- The BPM is changed, doubling the global speeds to 1 per second.
- 2 seconds later, a Magenta Circle is made to reach the ring in 1 second.
- BPM takes affect.
- A star is made at 45 degrees, reaching the ring in 1 second.
- A star is made at 46 degrees, reaching the ring in 1 second.
